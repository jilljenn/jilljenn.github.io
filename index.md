## Jill-Jênn Vie

<div style="padding: 1.5em 1.5em 1.5em 90px; background: url('/static/img/kashima-lab.png') #eee 10px 50% no-repeat; border-radius: 10px"><font color="red">Hey!</font> We organize a **data challenge about recommender systems** with Kyoto University.  
[Submissions open](http://research.mangaki.fr/2017/07/18/mangaki-data-challenge-en/) until **October 1**.</div>

<br />

<font color="red">New!</font> Our article [**BALSE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01584) is on arXiv!  
It has been accepted to the [**MANPU 2017**](http://manpu2017.imlab.jp) conference in Kyoto.

I'm a **postdoctoral researcher** in [RIKEN AIP](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) @ Tokyo and in [Kashima's Machine Learning Lab](http://www.ml.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/) @ Kyoto University.  
My **research interests** are: matrix factorization, crowdsourcing, and item response theory.

### Research Interests

- Adaptive Testing (Item Response Theory, Knowledge Space Theory), see my [benchmarks](https://github.com/jilljenn/qna) on GitHub
- Recommender Systems, Cold-Start
- Human Computation, Crowdsourcing

### Music

[![Trio ELM](/static/img/trioelm.png){align=right}](https://youtube.com/c/trioelm)

I'm the pianist of **Trio ELM**: together with two talented singers, we perform [anime and video game music](https://youtube.com/c/trioelm) in concerts.


### Achievements

✅ Cowriter of 2 books including the **Python package** [tryalgo](https://github.com/jilljenn/tryalgo/) → 128 algorithms for coding contests (also a French book)  
✅ Cofounder of a **programming summer school for K-12 girls** → [Girls Can Code!](https://gcc.prologin.org)  
✅ Core contributor of an open-source **anime recommender system** → [Mangaki](https://github.com/mangaki/mangaki/)  
✅ Director of a **TV show about algorithms** that take control of our lives → [Blame the Algorithm](http://fautealgo.fr)  
✅ Contributor to a **government report** → open sourcing the French college admission algorithm "APB" (similar to [NRMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program)).

- Being able to play all Kapustin ***Concert Études*** (so far only [1 over 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykHhf7D6vc))
- Finish Philip K. Dick's ***Ubik***
- Read Yasutaka Tsutsui's ***Gaspard of the Morning*** (in Japanese :/)
- Do not lose my Maths teacher license (= running gag)


### Publications

[See my Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7oCGHIMAAAAJ)

Books

:   I co-wrote two books about **algorithms and data structures**: preparing programming contests and coding interviews [@Durr2016] and [@Belghiti2016].  
The book is in French but the code is in Python: all [128 algorithms](https://github.com/jilljenn/tryalgo/) are on GitHub, in the Python package [tryalgo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tryalgo/1.2.2).

Book Chapters

:   I wrote a chapter about adaptive assessment [@Vie2016] in a learning analytics book. I tend to identify the similarities between cognitive diagnostic models and item response theory.

Conference Proceedings

:   I used to do cryptography in my master's degree and published an article about leakage resilience [@Abdalla2012].  
Used a General Diagnostic Model for adaptive testing and showed that it outperformed the DINA and Rasch models at predicting examinee performance [@Vie2016b].
