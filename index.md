# Jill-Jênn Vie

Hi! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [RIKEN Center for AIP](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=fr&q=riken%20aip) (Advanced Intelligence Project) in Tokyo, Japan, under the supervision of [Hisashi Kashima](http://www.ml.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/), professor at Kyoto University.

I also work for the French Ministry of Education on [PIX](https://pix.beta.gouv.fr), an open-source platform for certifying the digital competences of French citizens. I design their adaptive tests.

Also I enjoy playing the piano! Together with two talented singers, we perform [anime and video game music](https://youtube.com/c/trioelm) at concerts (Ghibli movies, Final Fantasy).

## Achievements

✅ Coauthor of the Python package [tryalgo](https://github.com/jilljenn/tryalgo/): short implementations of classic algorithms (minimum spanning trees, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, hungarian algorithm, Fenwick tree, etc.)  
✅ Cofounded a programming summer school for K-12 girls: [Girls Can Code!](https://gcc.prologin.org)  
✅ Cofounded an open-source anime recommender system: [Mangaki](https://github.com/mangaki/mangaki/)  
✅ Directed a TV show about algorithms that take control of our lives: [Blame the Algorithm](http://fautealgo.fr)  
✅ Missed an appointment with the [French Minister of Education](http://www.najat-vallaud-belkacem.com) because I had to teach.
