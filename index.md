> *We are organizing a [fairness workshop](https://fatedm.inria.fr/)* (**FATED 2020** @ [EDM](http://educationaldatamining.org/edm2020/))*, which will be fully virtual. [Call for papers](https://fatedm.inria.fr/) by May 15.*

I am a permanent research scientist at Inria in the [SequeL team](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/), interested in online factorization, deep generative models and educational applications of machine learning. I am now a board member of the [French Computer Science Society (SIF)](https://www.societe-informatique-de-france.fr/).

Feel free to contact: [vie@jill-jenn.net](mailto:vie@jill-jenn.net) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=jjvie).


### Research Interests

Deep generative models of human learning

:   *If we can generate log data from educational platforms (e.g. MOOCs), we can predict, explain and optimize student performance.  
See our [tutorial about knowledge tracing](https://github.com/jilljenn/ktm) and [the slides](http://jiji.cat/bigdata/iith-jjv.pdf) of our presentation in IIT Hyderabad.*

Recommender systems with side information

:   *How to model uncertainty and side information in preference elicitation? See our [demo Mangaki](https://mangaki.fr) in 5 languages and [keynote](http://research.mangaki.fr/2018/07/15/ai-for-manga-and-anime/)*.  
Using 330k ratings from Mangaki data, we organized a **data challenge** with Kyoto University [[problem]](http://research.mangaki.fr/2017/07/18/mangaki-data-challenge-en/) [[solutions]](http://research.mangaki.fr/2017/10/08/mangaki-data-challenge-winners-en/).

Adaptive testing for optimizing human learning

:   *How to [optimize human learning](https://humanlearn.io) by selecting the next item to ask? See our [workshop](https://humanlearn.io).*  
Multidimensional item response theory, cognitive diagnosis [[slides]](http://jill-jenn.net/_static/slides/genma-bsi.pdf), multistage testing, determinantal point processes [[slides]](http://jill-jenn.net/_static/slides/iacat2017.pdf) [[code]](https://github.com/jilljenn/qna).

![Our [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03388) **Knowledge Tracing Machines** has been presented at [**AAAI 2019**](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-19/) in Hawaii. See also our [code & tutorial](https://github.com/jilljenn/ktm).](/static/img/ktm-lr.png)

![Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01584) **Using Posters to Recommend Anime and Mangas in a Cold-Start Scenario** [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01584) [[slides]](http://jill-jenn.net/slides/manpu2017.pdf) has been accepted to [**MANPU 2017**](http://manpu2017.imlab.jp) in Kyoto.](/static/img/balse.png)

![We received the **Best Paper Award** at [**EDM 2019**](http://educationaldatamining.org/edm2019/) for our [learning/forgetting student model **DAS3H**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06873) [@Choffin2019].](/static/img/tw.png)

### Other achievements

✅ I designed and implemented [free software](https://github.com/1024pix/pix) that is used to certify the digital skills of every French citizen  
✅ **Organizing committee** of [PyParis](http://pyparis.org) 2017, 2018, [Educational Data Mining 2019](http://educationaldatamining.org/edm2019/), [Optimizing Human Learning 2018, 2019](https://humanlearn.io).  
✅ **Reviewer** for [*IEEE-Transactions on Learning Technologies*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4620076) (IEEE-TLT), [*Journal of Educational Data Mining*](https://jedm.educationaldatamining.org) (JEDM)  
✅ We organized a **programming summer school for K-12 girls** → [Girls Can Code!](https://gcc.prologin.org) running since 2014  
✅ We wrote and directed a **TV show about algorithms** that take control of our lives → [*La Faute à l'algo*](http://fautealgo.fr) (*Blame the Algorithm*)  
✅ Our TV show was mentioned by the [French Senate](http://www.senat.fr/rap/r16-464-1/r16-464-118.html#toc334) as an interesting example of popularization of AI
