#### Books

We wrote two books about **algorithms and data structures**: preparing programming contests and coding interviews [@Durr2016] and [@Belghiti2016].  
All [128 algorithms in Python](https://github.com/jilljenn/tryalgo/) from the book are available on GitHub, in the package [tryalgo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tryalgo/1.2.2).
