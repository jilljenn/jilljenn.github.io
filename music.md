### Piano

Since 2006, I've been recording many pieces on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Xnihpsel), see for example:

- [Terror in Resonance - walt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlg1n_jMtM0) by Yoko Kanno
- [Pokémon Red & Blue - Last Battle (VS Rival)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7fv2xgFUP8) by Junichi Masuda
- [Concert Étude Op. 40 No. 1 "Prelude"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykHhf7D6vc) by Nikolai Kapustin
- [Final Fantasy VII - Fighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kraAZIpYAEs) by Nobuo Uematsu

### Compositions

My prep school project was about [music composition through Markov chains](https://jill-jenn.net/_static/works/un-algorithme-de-composition-musicale.pdf) (in French).

Later, I used a similar Markov chain ([markov.py](https://github.com/jilljenn/markov.py)) to compose the music of the TV show [***La Faute à l'algo***](https://fautealgo.fr).

### Trio ELM

Together with [Sedeto](https://sedeto.carrd.co/) and Lily, we arranged pieces for 2 voices + piano: [Trio ELM](https://trioelm.com/).

We were also featured in the latest Yoko Kanno project: **Starducks**.
